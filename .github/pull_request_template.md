# Pull Request

<!--
Remember - PR names must be of the form `type(scope): description`

Where type is one of:
- feat       (A new feature)
- fix        (A bug fix)
- build      (Affecting the build system or adding dependencies)
- chore      (Changes that don't affect source/test files: grunt tasks that
              don't affect production code)
- ci         (GitHub Actions / other CI system changes)
- docs       (Documentation only changes)
- style      (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code)
- refactor   (Changes to the structure of the code that don't affect what it does)
- perf       (A code change that improves performance)
- test       (Adding or changing tests)

And scope (optionally) is one of:
- rendering
- game logic
- art
- documentation

If you have a scope that is not listed above, feel free to use it, then add it
to the options in this file (.github/pull_request_template.md)

If the change affects more than one (or even all) of these sections, you can
choose to not include the scope.
