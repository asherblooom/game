# A Game??????

Hopefully

## Setup instructions

- [Install GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Run `make linux` if on linux or `make windows` if on windows
- Run the resulting `game.o` file

### Notes

- When writing OpenGL files, include `glad.h` before `glfw3.h`

### Learning OpenGL and c++

- [This book is highly recommended and teaches more up to date OpenGl (ver. 4)](https://linker2.worldcat.org/?jHome=https%3A%2F%2Fbris.idm.oclc.org%2Flogin%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Flearning.oreilly.com%2Flibrary%2Fview%2F~%2F9780133365023%2F%3Far%26orpq%26email%3D%5Eu&linktype=best&jHomeSig=18d1b86a967d5206742890e689759fabdaea0ebe6659ddee4ef995593108d486)
