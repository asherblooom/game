# A Game??????

Hopefully

## Setup instructions

- [Install GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Run `make linux` if on linux or `make windows` if on windows
- Run the resulting `game.o` file

### Notes

- When writing OpenGL files, include `glad.h` before `glfw3.h`

### Learning OpenGL and c++

_note: the link should take you to a sign-in page for UoB which will then direct you to the e-book_
