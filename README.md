## Learning OpenGL and C++

### Main resources

- [This book is _highly_ recommended and teaches up to date OpenGl (ver. 4.5)](https://learning-oreilly-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/library/view/opengl-superbible-comprehensive/9780134193120/)
_note: the link should take you to a sign-in page for UoB which will then direct
you to the e-book_

- The book **"A Tour of C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup** (2nd or 3rd edition are good)
is also highly recommended as a quick reference guide to c++ compared
to the more indepth website linked below (You might be able to find a free pdf
online or access an ebook from the library website)

- [Here is a good website to learn c++](https://www.learncpp.com/) - but just
note it is _very very_ detailed and sometimes in a strange order

### Additional resources

- [This website teaches OpenGl ver. 3 (but is still good)](https://www.learnopengl.com/)
- [Another good opengl tutorial but again only version 3](https://www.open.gl)
