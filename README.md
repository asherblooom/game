Hopefully

## Setup instructions

- [Install GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Clone the repository

### Building the game

- Run `make linux` if on linux or `make windows` if on windows
- Run the resulting `game` file (located in the `bin` subdirectory)

### Building the examples

- Run `make examples` if on linux
- The example programs will be created in the location `examples/bin`

## Learning OpenGL and C++

### Main resources

- [This book](https://www-oreilly-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/library-access/?next=/library/view/~/9780133365023/?ar&orpq&email=tcAf2t%2bxyhAf4HyELvWxZNxKs3LYRtO0&tstamp=1747871539&id=F8CC5660B59938AF69A1F1CFF325D4DB7EBF877C) is highly recommended and teaches up to date OpenGl (ver. 4.5) - this
is also what the examples are based on. \
_Note: the link should take you to a sign-in page for UoB which will then direct
you to the **6th edition** e-book. You can access the **7th edition** (most recent edition) by scrolling down and selecting it_

- The book **"A Tour of C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup** (2nd or 3rd edition are good)
is also highly recommended as a quick reference guide to c++ compared
to the more indepth website linked below \
(You might be able to find a free pdf
online or access an ebook from the library website)

- [Here](https://www.learncpp.com/) is a good website to learn C++\
  just note it is _very very_ detailed and sometimes in a strange order

### Additional resources

- [This website](https://www.learnopengl.com/) teaches OpenGl ver. 3 (but is still good)
- [Another good opengl tutorial](https://www.open.gl) but again only version 3

These can be useful to provide extra detail/flesh out understanding
