Hopefully

## Setup instructions

- [Install GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Clone the repository

### Building the game

- Run `make linux` if on linux or `make windows` if on windows
- Run the resulting `game` file (located in the `bin` subdirectory)

### Building the examples

- Run `make examples` if on linux
- The example programs will be created in the location `examples/bin`

## Learning OpenGL and C++

### OpenGL

- [This book](https://linker2.worldcat.org/?jHome=https%3A%2F%2Fbris.idm.oclc.org%2Flogin%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Flearning.oreilly.com%2Flibrary%2Fview%2F~%2F9780133365023%2F%3Far%26orpq%26email%3D%5Eu&linktype=best&jHomeSig=18d1b86a967d5206742890e689759fabdaea0ebe6659ddee4ef995593108d486)
teaches up to date OpenGL (ver. 4.5) - it is somewhat detailed and
is also what the examples are based on. \
_Note: the link should take you to a sign-in page for UoB which will then direct
you to the **6th edition** e-book. You can access the **7th edition** (most recent edition) by scrolling down and selecting it_

- [This website](https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/index.html) is another good OpenGL 4 tutorial, which is simpler than the above
but covers some topics in a slightly different order

- [This website](https://www.learnopengl.com/) teaches OpenGl ver. 3 (but is still good)
and can be useful to provide extra detail/flesh out understanding\
_Note: the boilerplate code for the examples (and the accompanying libraries, i.e. GLAD and glfw) and the maths library (GLM) are
both taken from this website. Everything else is from the book_

### C++

- The book **"A Tour of C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup** (2nd or 3rd edition are good)
is good as a quick reference guide to C++ compared
to the more indepth website linked below \
(You might be able to find a free pdf
online or access an ebook from the library website)

- [Here](https://www.learncpp.com/) is a good website to learn C++\
Just note it is _very_ detailed and sometimes in a strange order
