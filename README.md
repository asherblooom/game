## Learning OpenGL and c++

- [This book is _highly_ recommended and teaches more up to date OpenGl (ver. 4)](https://learning-oreilly-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/library/view/opengl-superbible-comprehensive/9780134193120/)
_note: the link should take you to a sign-in page for UoB which will then direct you to the e-book_

- [This website teaches OpenGl ver. 3 (but is still good)](https://www.learnopengl.com/)
- [Here is a good website to learn c++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
